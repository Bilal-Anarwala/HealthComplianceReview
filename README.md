# HealthComplianceReview


This project focuses on a comprehensive compliance analysis for Green Sword Purple Armor (GSPA), a publicly traded health insurance company operating in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana. The objective was to evaluate and implement necessary compliance measures for GSPA to securely and legally operate within its jurisdiction. The project has 4 parts:

Determine Compliance Requirements: Research and document at least three major laws, regulations, or industry standards that GSPA must comply with, justifying their relevance.

Security Controls Requirements Table: Create a table or spreadsheet listing security controls necessary for compliance, referencing relevant sections from the regulations or standards, and noting whether each control is mandatory or optional.

Explain the Controls: Write brief descriptions for each control, explaining how it applies to the compliance requirements. You can also include any additional controls you believe should be implemented.

Recommendation for Implementation: Present an implementation plan, prioritizing the controls based on their criticality. 

Key Compliance Standards Evaulated:

*HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Ensuring the privacy and security of patient health information.*

*PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Safeguarding cardholder data for secure credit card transactions.*

*SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act): Improving the accuracy and reliability of financial disclosures for publicly traded companies.*
